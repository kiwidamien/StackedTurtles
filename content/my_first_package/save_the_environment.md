Summary: Environments allow you to distribute software to other users, where you don't know what packages they have installed. This is a better solution than using `reuirements.txt`, as the packages you install won't interfere with the users system. 

## Save the environment with conda (and how to let others run your programs)

If you have been developing in Python, you may have tried to distribute your program to friends and colleagues. It can be mildly annoying when they try to run your program and it fails because they don't have `obscurePackage42` installed. If you are nearby, then it is easy for you to call `pip install` a few times and get them started with your program. If you are trying to distribute a program to end users (or even some non-technical executives) then you really want something that is going to work "out of the box".

Using an environment has the additional benefit of having us deal with one specific _known_ version of Python. The problem of "which Python am I using?" is one familiar to many of us.

## The old way (and its drawbacks)

One way of doing this was to write a `requirements.txt` file. The format of this file was pretty simple:
```bash
# Installs 
# A version of numpy no older than 1.14.0
# Exactly the version 0.23.4 of Pandas
numpy>=1.14.0
pandas==0.23.4
```

A single command, `pip install -r requirements.txt` and everything would be written to the main Python repository. 

While simple to use, there are a couple of different problems with this approach:

* __Version conflicts:__ What if one application required version `0.23.4` of Pandas, but a different application required `0.19.0` (because it used a now deprecated feature)? We would have to reinstall from `requirements.txt` when switching between these applications.
* __Tracking dependencies:__ It can be difficult to keep track of which packages your application is actually using. You don't want to include all installed packages on your machine, as only a few are relevant to your application.

Environments were designed to address both of these issues.

## Environments

An _environment_ is a way of starting with a new Python installation, that doesn't look at your already installed packages. In this way, it simulates having a fresh install of Python. If two applications require different versions of Python, you can simply create different environments for them. If you start from a fresh environment and install as you go, you are able to generate a list of all packages installed in the environment so that others can easily duplicate it.

There are many different environments and dependency managers in the Python ecosystem. The most common ones in use are `virtualenv` and `conda` (but there are others such as `poetry`, `pyenv/pipenv`, `hatch` and probably many more I haven't heard of). This article is about using `conda` to manage environments, although all of these tools share the same broad goals. Some of the differences between these tools are touched on in the **Alternatives** section.

There are two steps to using an environment (with a third step needed if you want to use Jupyter notebooks)

1. Creating the environment, either from scratch (a new project) or from a yaml file (duplicating an environment)
2. Activating the environment for use.
3. Register the environment with Jupyter.

To leave an environment, we have to _deactivate_ it. The quickstart below will walk through the typical workflow.

### Using an environment (quickstart)

Let's say you wanted to create an environment `test_env` to do some testing with Python 3.6, and install numpy and Pandas. At the terminal, type the following:
```bash
# create the (empty) environment
$ conda create --name test_env python=3.6

# activate the environment
$ source activate test_env

# Now in the new environment, install the packages.
# Note the prompt will (typically) tell you about the environment
(test_env) $ conda install numpy pandas
```

If you want Jupyter notebooks to see your new environment, you need a couple of extra instructions. Jupyter sees the different environments as different _kernels_. Once we create a new environment, we need to tell Jupyter that it is there:
```bash
# Note you'll want to do this in the new environment.
# First we will need the ipykernel package
(test_env) $ conda install ipykernel

# This tells jupyter to take the current environment (test_env)
# and make a "kernel" option named "test kernel" in the 
# kernel menu
(test_env) $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name "test kernel"
```
When loading a jupyter notebook, you can use the menu options **Kernel->Change Kernel->test kernel** to ensure you are using the `test_env` environment.


Now you want to make an `environment.yaml` file that will allow others to recreate the environment from scratch. To make this file, we use the `export` command and send the output to `environment.yaml`:
```bash
# while in test_env, export the packages used to an environment file
(test_env) $ conda env export > environment.yaml
```

Once we are done with the environment, we can deactivate and delete the environment:
```bash
# Leave the environment
(test_env) $ source deactivate

# Now we are no longer in test_env, we can delete it
$ conda env remove --name test_env
```

### Making the environment again from the yaml file

If you have the yaml file (created from `conda env export`), then recreating the environment is a single command:
```bash
$ conda env create --file environment.yaml
```
Note that you don't need to supply the name of the new environment, as the yaml file also contains the name of the environment it saved. Make sure you don't give your environment an embarassing name, as everyone who recreates from the yaml file will see the name you used!

### Finding conda environments on your system

Of course, you may choose to deactivate your environment but keep it around for later. If you want to see the environments installed on your system, use 
```bash
$ conda env list
```

## Useful commands

Here is a brief summary of useful commands for environemnts. Anaconda has also published a [cheat sheet](https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) with a more extensive list of useful commands.
 
| | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Create a new environment `ENV_NAME` with Python version 3.X | `conda create --name ENV_NAME python=3.X`|
| Create a new environment `ENV_NAME` with some initial packages | `conda create --name ENV_NAME python=3.X pandas ipykernel` |
| Create a new environment from a yaml file | `conda env create --file environment.yaml` |
| Activate the environment `ENV_NAME` (OSX, Linux) | `source activate ENV_NAME` |
| Activate the environment `ENV_NAME` (Windows) | `activate ENV_NAME` |
| Deactivate the current environment (\*) | `source deactivate` |
| Delete the environment `ENV_NAME` | `conda env remove --name ENV_NAME` |
| List all installed environments | `conda env list` |
| Create a YAML file for active environment(\*) | `conda env export > environment.yaml` |

The commands with (\*) require you to have the environment active before using them. The naming is a little odd for creating environments: if creating them yourself the command is `conda create .....`, but if creating them from a yaml file we use `conda env create ......`. This is not a typo!
 
## Tip for maximizing portability

Some packages are system dependent (e.g. the Python Image Library `Pillow` is used by OSX and Linux, but not Windows). Once you create your `environment.yaml` file, it is often a good idea to eliminate packages you don't use directly. For example, if you tell conda to install `pandas` but not `numpy` it will figure out it needs `numpy` for `pandas` to work. You should aim to eliminate all the packages in `environment.yaml` except the ones you actually import, so that conda can figure out which other packages are needed for the user's system (which may be running a different operating system to yours).

## Summary

Creating environments allow us to make sure users we distribute our code to have the right packages (and the right versions of those packages installed) to run our code, without interfering with other programs. We _activate_ and environment to start using it, and _deactivate_ to leave again. 

If making a new environment that you want others to use, the workflow is
```python
$ conda create --name ENV_NAME python=3.X <packages to install>
$ source activate ENV_NAME
(ENV_NAME)$ ...... do stuff (e.g. write code, conda install more packages)
(ENV_NAME)$ conda env export > environment.yaml
(ENV_NAME)$ source deactivate
# back to regular shell
$
```

If you are using an environment someone else has created:
```python
$ conda env create --file environment.yaml
$ source activate ENV_NAME
(ENV_NAME)$ ..... do stuff (e.g. run program that uses this environment)
$ source deactivate
```

### Alternatives

* The original virtualenv. As the Jake VanderPlas article ["Conda: Myths and Misconceptions"](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/) points out, these are mostly interchangle if you are only installing python packages into your environment. In slightly more detail
    * `virtualenv/pip` installs python packages into _any_ environment, while
    * `conda` installs _any_ packages into _conda_ environments.
  
  If you are solely installing Python packages, there is not much difference between the two.

* [`pyenv/pipenv`](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by Kenneth Reitz. The main goal of this project was to automate/simplify environment creation, but is not as mature as either `virtualenv` or `conda` solutions.
* [`poetry`](https://poetry.eustace.io/) by SÃ©bastien Eustace, which aims to be a packaging and deployment tool.

With the exception of `virtualenv`, none of these solutions are as mature as `conda`. This is a piece of the Python that will hopefully improve and simplify, but for now, Randall Munroe's XKCD comic puts it well.
