Summary: Many of the classifiers in sklearn support a `predict_proba` method for calculating probabilities. Often, these "probabilities" are really just a score from 0 to 1, where a higher score means the model is more confident in the prediction, but it shouldn't be interpreted as a probability. This article shows us how to check if the "probabilities" should be interpreted as a actual probabilities, and a (limited) technique for correction.
