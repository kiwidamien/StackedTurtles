Summary: How to give a data science talk


When presenting data science results, finding the right level is frequently challenging.
Too technical, and you risk not making any impact. Too basic, and people are likely to dismiss your technical skills (this is especially challenging at the
job interview stage).

If you are a data scientist working at a particular company, things are a little bit easier - 
you can see which of your colleagues are influencing business partners and how.
If you are still trying to break into the field, or you are giving conference talks, it is a little bit harder to
get constructive feedback. 

This is common even in the academic world, where people's jobs are to convey and teach information. Lectures are often given to captive audiences,
which may explain why the art of presenting is not better developed. This is how Robert Geroch, an astrophysicist in Chicago, sums it up in a paper
on [giving talks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9703019.pdf)

This post takes the points made in that paper and translates them to data science.

## Big points

1. Consider your audience.
2. Have 3 or 4 things you want the audience to leave with (take home messages).
3. The way you think about a subject during analysis is different from how you should present it

  This is an excellent paper (but some of the terms are a little specific to general relativity)
