Summary: In software engineering, it is important to have a _single source of truth_. In data science, it is a little more complicated.

# Pet Peeve - Single Source of Truth

Take a moment to consider the meaning of the following adage:
> A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure.

This adage is known as [Segal's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segal%27s_law). On its surface, it seems to advocate that a single source of truth (i.e. only one method for determining time) allows for certainty, whereas having multiple measurements will lead to uncertainty.
