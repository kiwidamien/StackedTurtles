# Determining where to live

When moving to the Bay 

Need to mention inspiration from
https://www.dataquest.io/blog/apartment-finding-slackbot/

* Select areas of interest (manually?)
* Get an idea of rental prices (craigslist)

    :::python
    def printMe():
        print "This will not show line numbers"
        
Whereas
    
    #!python
    def printMe():
        print "This will show line numbers"
    
That's a wrap
