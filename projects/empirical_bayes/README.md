The article ["Data Pitfalls 2"](http://dataremixed.com/2015/01/avoiding-data-pitfalls-part-2/) did a good job talking about the effect of sample size, but didn't use Bayesian methods to correct it. In a similar vein, Cameron Davidson Pilon mentioned taking sample size into account when building machine learning models in his video ["Mistakes I've Made"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWtsTIbFXxA).

The boardgame data was put together by Github user Rasmus Greve, but was discussed in detail on the 538 blog ["Worst board game ever invented"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-worst-board-games-ever-invented/). Using the data, we are able to correct small sample sizes.
